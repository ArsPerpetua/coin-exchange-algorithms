# Coin Exchange Algorithms  

Implementation of **Brute Force** and **Greedy Algorithms** for the **Coin Exchange Problem**. This project compares both approaches in optimizing cash exchange, analyzing efficiency, and time complexity.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Brute Force Algorithm**: Finds the optimal solution but has high computational cost.  
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Faster execution but may not always produce the optimal solution.  
- **Performance Analysis**: Compares time complexity and efficiency of both algorithms.  
- **GUI & Terminal Implementation**: Provides both graphical and command-line interfaces.
